In order to maintain my git repository, which is currently located in my src folder, I had to put the build.xml in the parent work folder for my own testing. I'm hoping that the server's exploration folder will be sufficient, but in case it is not, a copy of my build.xml file is submitted on canvas. Place it with the src folder. If you get an error saying jacoco.exec cannot be reached, simply create a blank jacoco.exec file and it will work. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I couldn't get it working any other way :(
